Compatibility/Demos:

Q: I'm trying to play a demo, but it gets out of sync, what's wrong?
A: Read README.compatibility if you don't have already.
A: If everything failes report us which demo got out of sync and where we can
get it. Don't send it to us directly. Now hope the best that it gets fixed.

Linux:

Q: I get wrong colors when using SVGALib, can't you do your job right?
A: The SDL Library is broken, bug the SDL people about it.

OpenGL:

Q: I'm trying to get PrBoom with OpenGL working on my 3dfx Voodoo card on
Windows, but it doesn't work or is very slow.
A: Use Mesa3D (http://www.mesa3d.org) with 3dfx support.

Q: The sky looks wrong in OpenGL, WTF?
A: It seems like you are using Mesa3D. Try a newer version and if it's still not
fixed bug them about it.
A: Are you using Windows? Try using another glu32.dll.

Q: I get a compile error saying PFNGLCOLORTABLEEXTPROC isn't defined
A: Get a newer version of your OpenGL headers/drivers. This problem occured on
nvidia cards. If you still can't get it working, the please tell us.
